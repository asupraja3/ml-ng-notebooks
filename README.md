# ML-Ng-Notebooks

This repository contains a structured set of Jupyter notebooks that implement and extend the concepts from Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning curriculum.  
The focus is on **clear mathematical formulations, reproducible experiments, and hands-on coding practice** rather than theory alone.

## Repository Structure

- **1_RegressionAndClassification/**  
  Linear regression, logistic regression, decision boundaries, and regularization with detailed plots.

- **2_AdvancedLearningAlgorithms/**  
  Neural networks, error analysis, bias-variance tradeoffs, and optimization strategies.

- **3_Unsupervised_Reinforcement/**  
  K-means, PCA, anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning fundamentals.

---

## Key Highlights
- Notebooks include **step-by-step derivations** of cost functions, gradients, and decision boundaries.  
- Focus on **vectorized implementations** for efficiency.  
- **Visualization-rich approach** to aid intuition.  
- Organized modularly to allow easy navigation and reuse.
